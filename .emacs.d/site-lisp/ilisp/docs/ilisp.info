How to get the latest ILISP distribution.
*****************************************

ILISP is "free"; this means that everyone is free to use it and free
to redistribute it on a free basis.  ILISP is not in the public
domain; it is copyrighted and there are restrictions on its
distribution, but these restrictions are designed to permit everything
that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.  What is not allowed
is to try to prevent others from further sharing any version of ILISP
that they might get from you.  The precise conditions appears
following this section.

The easiest way to get a copy of ILISP is from someone else who has
it.  You need not ask for permission to do so, or tell any one else;
just copy it.

ILISP replaces the standard inferior Lisp mode.  ILISP is based on
comint mode and derived from a number of different interfaces
including Symbolics, CMU Common Lisp, and Thinking Machines.

There are many people that have taken the time to report bugs, make
suggestions and even better send code to fix bugs or implement new
features.

Introduction
************

ILISP is an interface from GNU Emacs to an inferior Lisp.  It has the
following features:

   * Runs under Emacs-18, Emacs-19, Emacs-20, and XEmacs-19.

   * Support for multiple Common Lisp (including Allegro, CLISP and
     CMU), XLisp and Scheme dialects on multiple machines even at the
     same time.

   * Dynamically sized pop-up windows that can be buried and scrolled
     from any window.

   * Packages are properly handled including the distinction between
     exported and internal symbols.

   * Synchronous, asynchronous or batch eval and compile of files,
     regions, definitions and sexps with optional switching and
     automatic calling.

   * Arglist, documentation, describe, inspect and macroexpand.

   * Completion of filename components and Lisp symbols including
     partial matches.

   * Find source both with and without help from the inferior Lisp,
     including CLOS methods, multiple definitions and multiple files.


   * Edit the callers of a function with and without help from the
     inferior Lisp.

   * Trace/untrace a function.

   * `M-q' ("Fill-paragraph") works properly on paragraphs in
     comments, strings and code.

   * Find unbalanced parentheses.

   * Super brackets.

   * Handles editing, entering and indenting full Lisp expressions.

   * Next, previous, and similar history mechanism compatible with
     comint.

   * Handles Lisp errors.

   * Uniform interface to Lisp debuggers.

   * Result histories are maintained in the inferior Lisp.

   * Does not create spurious symbols and handles case issues.

   * Online manuals for ILISP and Common Lisp.

How to install ILISP
********************
Installation of ILISP and some initialization of your computing
environment are described in this chapter.  Please read the following
sections carefully before getting started with ILISP.

Copy the ILISP distribution archive, e.g. `ilisp-x.y.z.tar.gz', to the
location where you would like to install it. Next extract the archive,
see *Note FTP and Web directions::. You may need root privileges to
perform these operations.



* Menu:

* Configuration and compilation::
* Files of ILISP::



File: ilisp.info, Node: Configuration and compilation, Next: Files of ILISP, Up: Installation

Configuration and compilation
=============================

Some configuration needs to be done before compiling the Emacs Lisp
files that comprise ILISP.  Start with the `Makefile' file, in the
section after the comment `Various variables' (you can safely ignore
the variables for configuring packaging and distribution, which are
intended for maintainers).

First, set the `EMACS' variable to be the pathname of the Emacs you
will be using ILISP with. This is the Emacs that will be used to
compile ILISP with. Be sure to check that `LN' and `HyperSpec' have
appropriate values for your system, *especially if you are a Windows
user*.


If your Emacs supports the `easymenu' package, it is possible to make
ILISP add to Lisp mode buffers and buffers with inferior Lisp
processes, or to Scheme mode buffers and buffers with inferior Scheme
processes, an `Ilisp' menu with all available commands. To enable this
feature, set to `t' the variable `ilisp-*enable-cl-easy-menu-p*' in
`ilisp-def.el' for the Common Lisp dialects, and
`ilisp-*enable-scheme-easy-menu-p*' for Scheme dialects. Setting these
variables also causes the default `Lisp' menu to be removed before
displaying the `Ilisp' one.

See the file `INSTALLATION' for additional configuration options and
known problems for specific Lisp dialects.

Run `make' or `make compile' to build ILISP from source.  Ignore any
compilation warnings unless they result in ILISP not compiling
completely. If you are a Windows user, and you don't have GNU `make',
you can still compile ILISP by running the `icompile.bat' batch file
(be sure to customize for your system the variables mentioned by the
comment at the top).

For reducing the Emacs startup time you may run `make loadfile'. This
concatenates all `.elc' (the compiled Emacs Lisp files) into an
`ilisp-all.elc' file and removes the `*.elc' files. So your Emacs can
load one single compiled file faster than a bunch of smaller compiled
files.

To activate ILISP you should add appropriate Emacs Lisp forms to your
`.emacs' or to the system-wide `default.el' file, depending on who
will be using ILISP. These forms take care of starting it whenever you
access a Lisp file or run an inferior Lisp process. You can copy
relevant portions of the sample file `ilisp.emacs', which also shows
how to customize some ILISP features.

You should add the directory where all of the ILISP Emacs Lisp files
reside to your `load-path'.  There is an example of this in
`ilisp.emacs'.

As an alternative you could set up a `.ilisp' which contains the
appropriate portions of `ilisp.emacs', in order to avoid cluttering
too much `.emacs' or `default.el'.

The first time a dialect is started, the interface files will complain
about not being compiled, just ignore the message.  Once a Lisp
dialect is started up, you should execute the command
`ilisp-compile-inits' which will compile the `*.lisp' files and write
them to the same directory as the ILISP files.

The binary files should have a unique extension for each different
combination of architecture and Lisp dialect.  You will need to change
`ilisp-init-binary-extension' and `ilisp-init-binary-command' to get
additional extensions.  The binary for each different architecture
should be different.  If you want to build the interface files into a
Lisp world, you will also need to set `ilisp-load-inits' to `nil' in
the same place that you change `ilisp-program' to load the Lisp world.

There is an `ilisp-site-hook' for initializing site specific stuff
like program locations when ILISP is first loaded.  You may want to
define appropriate autoloads in your system Emacs start up file.

Example site init:
     ;;; CMU site
     (setq ilisp-site-hook
           '(lambda ()
             (setq ilisp-motd "CMU ILISP V%s")
             (setq expand-symlinks-rfs-exists t)
             (setq allegro-program "/usr/local/acl5/lisp")
             (setq lucid-program "/usr/misc/.lucid/bin/lisp")))

Kent Pitman and Xanalys Inc. have made publicly available on the Web
the Common Lisp HyperSpec, an HTML version of the full text of the
ANSI Common Lisp specification:
     http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec/
It is also possible to get a local copy of the HyperSpec, whose latest
version is currently v6, by downloading the file
`HyperSpec-6-0.tar.gz' from the above mentioned site.

Daniel Barlow, Stephen Carney and Erik Naggum independently developed
Emacs Lisp packages for looking up Lisp symbols in the HyperSpec and
displaying the relevant sections with a Web browser. ILISP used to
include all of them in the `extra' directory of the distribution tree.
However, because of some changes to the CLHS only Erik Naggum's
version is now distributed.  If you want to use one of the others,
please contact the other authors.

The `ilisp.emacs' file provides sample instructions for making
Naggum's package access a local copy of the HyperSpec. Since the
package relies on the `browse-url' Emacs package, make sure that the
latter is properly configured.

Digital Press has made publicly available online, as a service to the
Lisp community, the full text of the book "Common Lisp, The Language"
(by Guy L. Steele Jr., 2nd edition, Digital Press, 1990, ISBN
1-55558-041-6; a.k.a. "CLtL2") in a number of formats, including HTML.
ILISP provides support, contributed by Utz-Uwe Haus, for looking up
Lisp symbols in the HTML version of the book and displaying the
relevant sections with a Web browser.  See the file `extra/cltl2.el'
for more information on configuring this feature. *Note Documentation
functions::, for usage instructions.

The `ilisp.emacs' file provides sample instructions for making ILISP's
CLtL2 support access a local copy of the book.  What has been said
above about `browse-url' configuration also applies to CLtL2 lookup.

Note that, althouth Steele's book is a well written and useful
resource, it covers the Common Lisp language in the state it was a few
years before ANSI standardization.  If you need an accurate
description of ANSI Common Lisp, see the above mentioned HyperSpec
instead.

Previous versions of ILISP provided commands for accessing the online
Common Lisp documentation shipped with Franz Inc.'s Allegro CL product
(`fi:clman' module). The public availability of the HyperSpec, and
the inclusion since version 5.9 of ILISP of the `hyperspec'
packages, make access to the Franz documentation no longer necessary. So
by default ILISP does not load the `fi:clman' module, but if you
still want to use its commands set the
`ilisp-*use-fi-clman-interface-p*' to `t' in
`ilisp-def.el'.

The ILISP documentation consists of a user manual and a reference card
(the latter may not be up to date). Both of them are in the `docs'
directory of the distribution tree.

The generation of GNU Info, DVI, PostScript and HTML versions of the
documentation from the Texinfo and TeX source is controlled by the
`Makefile' in the `docs' directory. Run `make docs' or just `make' to
generate all of the formats. If you are interested in only some of
them then issue the appropriate command: `make info' for GNU Info,
`make dvi' for DVI, `make ps' for PostScript and `make html' for
HTML. To remove the intermediate files produced during the generation
of DVI output you can run `make tmpclean'. Note that some of the
output formats may not be supported for certain documents.

The ILISP reference card is available as a TeX source file. Check the
comments at the beginning of the file if you need to generate a
version with a different number of columns (the default is 3).

How to run a Lisp process using ILISP
*************************************

To start a Lisp use `M-x run-ilisp', or a specific dialect like `M-x
allegro'.  If called with a prefix you will be prompted for a buffer
name and a program to run.  The default buffer name is the name of the
dialect.  The default program for a dialect will be the value of
DIALECT-program or the value of ilisp-program inherited from a less
specific dialect.  If there are multiple Lisp's, use the dialect name
or `M-x select-ilisp' (`C-z S') to select the current ILISP buffer.

Entry into ILISP mode runs the hooks on `comint-mode-hook' and
`ilisp-mode-hook' and then DIALECT-hooks specific to Lisp
dialects in the nesting order above.  Many dialects call
`ilisp-load-init' in their dialect setup.

These are the currently supported dialects.

A word about the keys used by ILISP
***********************************

By default, most ILISP commands are bound under the prefix key C-z.
Unfortunately, these bindings predate the modern FSF Emacs keyspace
policies, which stipulate that packages should use C-c as a prefix,
and bind only control characters, digits, and a few specific
punctuation chars under that prefix.

If you are already accustomed to the old ILISP bindings, don't
worry -- we haven't changed the default.  However, for new users who
don't have old habits to unlearn, ILISP offers FSF-compliant bindings
as an alternative to the default.  To be compliant (and who wouldn't
want to be compliant?), put this line in your `.emacs' or in the
system-wide `default.el' file:

        (setq ilisp-*use-fsf-compliant-keybindings* t)

This will cause the ILISP prefix key to be C-c, and also change some
of the bindings underneath that prefix.  After you do this, ILISP will
be almost fully FSF-compliant; there are still a few bindings that
technically violate the FSF policy, but we left them as they were
because we judged that changing them would not have been an
improvement.

Because the rest of this document was originally written for the old,
default ILISP bindings, you'll need to make some mental translations
if you choose FSF-compliance:


   * Everywhere you see C-z given as a prefix key, substitute C-c.

   * If the second part of the keybinding is a plain alphabetic character,
     the modern binding is (usually) the same character with the
     `Control' key held down.  Thus, the old keybinding (given in full)
     `C-z w' would be `C-c C-w' in the new system.

   * If the second part of the keybinding is *already* a `Control'
     character, then translate it to the corresponding `Meta' character
     instead (because many of the former control characters were evicted by
     the change described in the previous item).  Thus, the old
     `C-z C-n' is now `C-c M-n'.


Where possible, the new bindings follow the above rules, but note that
some exceptions were necessary.  Most notably, the old `C-c *'
bindings are all under `C-c 8' now.  The remaining exceptions are
probably best discovered through regular use, as they tend to occur on
obscure keys anyway.  Remember that you can type `C-h m' at any time
to see help on the current major mode, which will show (among other
things) a list of all currently active keybindings.

Buffers used by ILISP, and their commands
*****************************************

`*DIALECT*'
     The Lisp listener buffer.  Forms can be entered in this buffer
     in, and they will be sent to Lisp when you hit return if the form
     is complete.  This buffer is in ilisp-mode, which is built on top
     of comint-mode, and all comint commands such as history mechanism
     and job control are available.

`LISP-MODE-BUFFERS'
     A buffer is assumed to contain Lisp source code if its major mode
     is in the list `lisp-source-modes'.  If it's loaded into a buffer
     that is in one of these major modes, it's considered a Lisp
     source file by `find-file-lisp', `load-file-lisp' and
     `compile-file-lisp'.  Used by these commands to determine
     defaults.

``*Completions*''
     Used for listing completions of symbols or files by the completion commands.
     *Note Completion::.

`*Aborted Commands*'
     *Note Interrupts::.

`*Errors*'
`*Output*'
`*Error Output*'
     used to pop-up results and errors from the inferior Lisp.

`*ilisp-send*'
     Buffer containing the last form sent to the inferior Lisp.

`*Edit-Definitions*'
`*All-Callers*'
     *Note Source code commands::.

`*Last-Changes*'
`*Changed-Definitions*'
     *Note Batch commands::.

* Menu:

* Typeout windows::              temporary windows used for display.
* Switching buffers::           Switching buffers



File: ilisp.info, Node: Typeout windows, Next: Switching buffers, Up: Buffers of ILISP

Typeout windows
===============

All ILISP output is funneled through the function which is bound to
the hook `ilisp-display-output-function'.  The function gets a single
argument, a string, and should make that output visible to the user
somehow.

One possible choice for output display is
`ilisp-display-output-in-typeout-window',
which pops up a window at the top of the current screen which is
just large enough to display the output.  This window can be
"remotely controlled" by the commands `ilisp-scroll-output',
`ilisp-bury-output', and `ilisp-grow-output'.

Unlike the old popper facility, the ilisp typeout window facility does
not trounce on any existing Emacs functions or on any common key
bindings, like `C-x o'.

Other built-in functions which might be useful as values for
`ilisp-display-output-function' include
`ilisp-display-output-default',
`ilisp-display-output-adaptively',
`ilisp-display-output-in-lisp-listener',
`ilisp-display-output-in-temp-buffer', and
`ilisp-display-output-in-typeout-window'.

The default display function is `ilisp-display-output-default', which
obeys the `lisp-no-popper' variable.

Users are encouraged to write their own output display functions to
get the exact desired behavior, displaying on a private Emacs screen,
in a pop-up dialog box, or whetever.



`C-z 1   (ilisp-bury-output)'
     deletes and buries the typeout output window.


`C-z v   (ilisp-scroll-output)'
     scrolls the output window if it is showing, otherwise does
     nothing.  If it is called with a negative prefix, it will scroll
     backwards.

`C-z G   (ilisp-grow-output)'
     will grow the output window if showing by the prefix number of
     lines.


An alternative to typeout windows is to always have the inferior Lisp
buffer visible and have all output go there.  Setting `lisp-no-popper'
to `t' will cause all output to go to the inferior Lisp buffer.
Setting `lisp-no-popper' to `'message' will make output of one line go
to the message window. Setting `comint-always-scroll' to `t' will
cause process output to always be visible.  If a command gets an
error, you will be left in the break loop.

Switching buffers
=================

Commands to make switching between buffers easier.

`C-z b   (switch-to-lisp)'
     will pop to the current ILISP buffer or if already in an ILISP
     buffer, it will return to the buffer that last switched to an
     ILISP buffer.  With a prefix, it will also go to the end of the
     buffer.  If you do not want it to pop, set `pop-up-windows' to
     nil.


`M-C-l   (previous-buffer-lisp)'
     will switch to the last visited buffer in the current window or
     the Nth previous buffer with a prefix.

File: ilisp.info, Node: Eval and compile functions, Next: Documentation functions, Up: ILISP Commands

Eval and compile functions
==========================

In Lisp, the major unit of interest is a form, which is anything
between two matching parentheses.  Some of the commands here also
refer to "defun," which is a list that starts at the left margin in a
Lisp buffer, or after a prompt in the ILISP buffer.  These commands
refer to the "defun" that contains the point.

"A call" refers to a reference to a function call for a function or
macro, or a reference to a variable.  Commands which "insert a call"
in the ILISP buffer will bring up the last command which matches it or
else will insert a template for a call.

When an eval is done of a single form matching `ilisp-defvar-regexp'
the corresponding symbol will be unbound and the value assigned again.

When you send a form to Lisp, the status light will reflect the
progress of the command.  In a Lisp mode buffer the light will reflect
the status of the currently selected inferior Lisp unless
`lisp-show-status' is nil. The very first inferior Lisp command
executed may send some forms to initialize the inferior Lisp. If you
want to find out what command is currently running, use the command
`C-z s' (status-lisp).  If you call it with a prefix, the pending
commands will be displayed as well.

Note that in this table as elsewhere, the key C-z (ilisp-*prefix*) is
used as a prefix character for ILISP commands, though this may be
changed.  For a full list of key-bindings, use `M-x describe-mode' or
`M-x describe-bindings' while in an ILISP-mode buffer.


The eval/compile commands verify that their expressions are balanced
and then send the form to the inferior Lisp.  If called with a
positive prefix, the result of the operation will be inserted into the
buffer after the form that was just sent.

For commands which operate on a region, the result of the compile or
eval is the last form in the region.

The `and-go' versions will perform the operation and then immediately
switch to the ILISP buffer where you will see the results of executing
your form.  If `eval-defun-and-go-lisp' or `compile-defun-and-go-lisp'
is called with a prefix, a call for the form will be inserted as well.


`C-z'
     The prefix-key for most ILISP commands.  This can be changed by
     setting the variable `ilisp-*prefix*'.

`RET   (return-ilisp)'
     In ILISP-mode buffer, sends the current form to lisp if complete,
     otherwise creates a new line and indents.  If you edit old input,
     the input will be copied to the end of the buffer first and then
     sent.

`C-]   (close-and-send-lisp)'
     Closes the current sexp, indents it, and then sends it to the
     current inferior Lisp.

`LFD   (newline-and-indent-lisp)'
     Insert a new line and then indent to the appropriate level.  If
     called at the end of the inferior Lisp buffer and an sexp, the
     sexp will be sent to the inferior Lisp without a trailing
     newline.

`C-z e   (eval-defun-lisp)'
`M-C-x   (eval-defun-lisp)'
`C-z C-e   (eval-defun-and-go-lisp)'
     Send the defun to Lisp.

`C-z r   (eval-region-lisp)'
`C-z C-r   (eval-region-and-go-lisp)'

`C-z n   (eval-next-sexp-lisp)'
`C-z C-n   (eval-next-sexp-and-go-lisp)'

`C-z c   (compile-defun-lisp)'
`C-z C-c   (compile-defun-lisp-and-go)'
     When `compile-defun-lisp' is called in an inferior Lisp buffer
     with no current form, the last form typed to the top-level will
     be compiled.

`C-z w   (compile-region-lisp)'
`C-z C-w   (compile-region-and-go-lisp)'



If any of the forms contain an interactive command, then the command
will never return.  To get out of this state, you need to use
`abort-commands-lisp' (`C-z g').  If `lisp-wait-p'
is t, then EMACS will display the result of the command in the
minibuffer or a pop-up window.  If `lisp-wait-p' is `nil',
(the default) the send is done asynchronously and the results will be
brought up only if there is more than one line or there is an error.  In
this case, you will be given the option of ignoring the error, keeping
it in another buffer or keeping it and aborting all pending sends.  If
there is not a command already running in the inferior Lisp, you can
preserve the break loop.  If called with a negative prefix, the sense of
`lisp-wait-p' will be inverted for the next command.

Documentation functions
=======================

`describe-lisp', `inspect-lisp', `arglist-lisp', and
`documentation-lisp' switch whether they prompt for a response or use
a default when called with a negative prefix.  If they are prompting,
there is completion through the inferior Lisp by using `TAB' or
`M-TAB'.  When entering an expression in the minibuffer, all of the
normal ILISP commands like `arglist-lisp' also work.

Commands that work on a function will use the nearest previous
function symbol.  This is either a symbol after a `#'' or the symbol
at the start of the current list.

The `fi:clman' and `fi:clman-apropos' commands for accessing
the Franz Allegro CL documentation are not enabled by default.
*Note Configuration and compilation::.


`C-z a   (arglist-lisp)'
     Return the arglist of the current function.  With a numeric
     prefix, the leading paren will be removed and the arglist will be
     inserted into the buffer.

`SPC   (ilisp-arglist-message-lisp-space)'
     Display the value of the argument list of a symbol followed by
     SPC. *To enable this feature you have to set
     `ilisp-*arglist-message-lisp-space-p*' to `t'.*

`C-z d   (documentation-lisp)'
     Infers whether function or variable documentation is desired.
     With a negative prefix, you can specify the type of documentation
     as well.  With a positive prefix the documentation of the current
     function call is inserted into the buffer.

`C-z i   (describe-lisp)'
     Describe the previous sexp (it is evaluated).  If there is no
     previous sexp and if called from inside an ILISP buffer, the
     previous result will be described.

`C-z I   (inspect-lisp)'
     Switch to the current inferor Lisp and inspect the previous sexp
     (it is evaluated).  If there is no previous sexp and if called
     from inside an ILISP buffer, the previous result will be
     inspected.

`C-z H   (hyperspec-lookup)'
     Look up a standard symbol in the Common Lisp HyperSpec and
     display the relevant section.

`C-z L or C-z M-l   (cltl2-lookup)'
     Look up a Common Lisp symbol in the CLtL2 book and display the
     relevant section.

`C-z D   (fi:clman)'
`C-z A   (fi:clman-apropos)'
     If the Franz online Common Lisp manual is available, get
     information on a specific symbol.  `fi:clman-apropos' will get
     information apropos a specific string.  Some of the documentation
     is specific to the Allegro dialect, but most of it is for
     standard Common Lisp.

Macroexpansion
==============

`C-z M   (macroexpand-lisp)'
`C-z m   (macroexpand-1-lisp)'
     These commands apply to the next sexp.  If called with a positive
     numeric prefix, the result of the macroexpansion will be inserted
     into the buffer.  With a negative prefix, prompts for expression
     to expand.





File: ilisp.info, Node: Tracing functions, Next: Package Commands, Prev: Macroexpansion, Up: ILISP Commands

Tracing functions
=================

`C-z t   (trace-defun-lisp)'
     traces the current defun.  When called with a numeric prefix the
     function will be untraced.  When called with negative prefix,
     prompts for function to be traced.
`C-z C-t   (trace-defun-lisp-break)'
     traces the current defun and enters the debugger whenever that
     function is invoked.  When called with a numeric prefix the
     function will be untraced.  When called with negative prefix,
     prompts for function to be traced.



File: ilisp.info, Node: Package Commands, Next: Source code commands, Prev: Tracing functions, Up: ILISP Commands

Package Commands
================

The first time an inferior Lisp mode command is executed in a Lisp
Mode buffer, the package will be determined by using the regular
expression `ilisp-hash-form-regexp' to find a package sexp and then
passing that sexp to the inferior Lisp through
`ilisp-package-command'.  For the `common-lisp' dialect, this will
find the first `(in-package PACKAGE)' form in the file.  A buffer's
package will be displayed in the mode line.  If a buffer has no
specification, forms will be evaluated in the current inferior Lisp
package.

Buffer package caching can be turned off by setting the variable
`lisp-dont-cache-package' to `T'.  This will force ILISP to search for
the closest previous "in-package" form corresponding to
`ilisp-hash-form-regexp' in the buffer each time an inferior Lisp mode
command is executed.


`C-z P   (set-package-lisp)'
     Set the inferior Lisp package to the current buffer's package or
     with a prefix to a manually entered package.

`C-z p   (set-buffer-package-lisp)'
     Set the buffer's package from the buffer.  If it is called with a
     prefix, the package can be set manually.




File: ilisp.info, Node: Source code commands, Next: Batch commands, Prev: Package Commands, Up: ILISP Commands

Source Code Commands
====================

The following commands all deal with finding things in source code.
The first time that one of these commands is used, there may be some
delay while the source module is loaded.  When searching files, the
first applicable rule is used:
   * try the inferior Lisp,
   * try a tags file if defined,
   * try all buffers in one of `lisp-source-modes' or all files
     defined using `lisp-directory'.

`M-x lisp-directory' defines a set of files to be searched by the
source code commands.  It prompts for a directory and sets the source
files to be those in the directory that match entries in
`auto-mode-alist' for modes in `lisp-source-modes'.  With a positive
prefix, the files are appended.  With a negative prefix, all current
buffers that are in one of `lisp-source-modes' will be searched.  This
is also what happens by default.  Using this command stops using a
tags file.

`edit-definitions-lisp', `who-calls-lisp', and `edit-callers-lisp'
will switch whether they prompt for a response or use a default when
called with a negative prefix.  If they are prompting, there is
completion through the inferior Lisp by using `TAB' or `M-TAB'.  When
entering an expression in the minibuffer, all of the normal ILISP
commands like `arglist-lisp' also work.

`edit-definitions-lisp' (`M-.') will find a particular type of
definition for a symbol.  It tries to use the rules described above.
The files to be searched are listed in the buffer
`*Edit-Definitions*'.  If `lisp-edit-files' is nil, no search will be
done if not found through the inferior Lisp.  The variable
`ilisp-locator' contains a function that when given the name and type
should be able to find the appropriate definition in the file.  There
is often a flag to cause your Lisp to record source files that you
will need to set in the initialization file for your Lisp.  The
variable is `*record-source-files*' in both allegro and lucid.  Once a
definition has been found, `next-definition-lisp' (`M-,') will find
the next definition (or the previous definition with a prefix).

`edit-callers-lisp' (`C-z ^') will generate a list of all of the
callers of a function in the current inferior Lisp and edit the first
caller using `edit-definitions-lisp'.  Each successive call to
`next-caller-lisp' (`M-`') will edit the next caller (or the previous
caller with a prefix).  The list is stored in the buffer
`*All-Callers*'.  You can also look at the callers by doing `M-x
who-calls-lisp'.

`search-lisp' (`M-?') will search the current tags files,
`lisp-directory' files or buffers in one of `lisp-source-modes' for a
string or a regular expression when called with a prefix.
`next-definition-lisp' (`M-,') will find the next definition (or the
previous definition with a prefix).

`replace-lisp' (`M-"') will replace a string (or a regexp with a
prefix) in the current tags files, `lisp-directory' files or buffers
in one of `lisp-source-modes'.


Here is a summary of the above commands (behavior when given prefix
argument is given in parentheses):

`M-x lisp-directory'
     Define a set of files to be used by the source code commands.

`M-.   (edit-definitions-lisp)'
     Find definition of a symbol.

`M-,   (next-definition-lisp)'
     Find next (previous) definition.

`C-z ^   (edit-callers-lisp)'
     Find all callers of a function, and edit the first.

`M-`   (next-caller-lisp)'
     Edit next (previous) caller of function set by
     `edit-callers-lisp'.

`M-x who-calls-lisp'
     List all the callers of a function.


`M-?   (search-lisp)'
     Search for string (regular expression) in current tags,
     `lisp-directory' files or buffers.  Use `next-definition-lisp' to
     find next occurence.

`M-"   (replace-lisp)'
     Replace a string (regular expression) in files.

Batch commands
==============


The following commands all deal with making a number of changes all at
once.  The first time one of these commands is used, there may be some
delay as the module is loaded.  The eval/compile versions of these
commands are always executed asynchronously.

`mark-change-lisp' (`C-z SPC') marks the current defun as being
changed.  A prefix causes it to be unmarked.  `clear-changes-lisp'
(`C-z * 0') will clear all of the changes.  `list-changes-lisp' (`C-z
* l') will show the forms currently marked.

`eval-changes-lisp' (`C-z * e'), or `compile-changes-lisp' (`C-z * c')
will evaluate or compile these changes as appropriate.  If called with
a positive prefix, the changes will be kept.  If there is an error,
the process will stop and show the error and all remaining changes
will remain in the list.  All of the results will be kept in the
buffer `*Last-Changes*'.

Summary:

`C-z SPC   (mark-change-lisp)'
     Mark (unmark) current defun as changed.
`C-z * e   (eval-changes-lisp)'
`C-z * c   (compile-changes-lisp)'
     Call with a positive prefix to keep changes.
`C-z * 0   (clear-changes-lisp)'
`C-z * l   (list-changes-lisp)'

Files and directories
=====================

File commands in Lisp source-mode buffers keep track of the last used
directory and file.  If the point is on a string, that will be the
default if the file exists.  If the buffer is one of
`lisp-source-modes', the buffer file will be the default.  Otherwise,
the last file used in a lisp-source-mode will be used.


`C-x C-f   (find-file-lisp)'
     will find a file.  If it is in a string, that will be used as the
     default if it matches an existing file.  Symbolic links are
     expanded so that different references to the same file will end
     up with the same buffer.

`C-z l   (load-file-lisp)'
     will load a file into the inferior Lisp.  You will be given the
     opportunity to save the buffer if it has changed and to compile the file
     if the compiled version is older than the current version. For
     `<whatever>.system' files, which are used by DEFSYSTEM tools, no
     compilation or loading of possibly existing
     `<whatever>.binary-extension' is attempted.

`C-z k   (compile-file-lisp)'
     will compile a file in the current inferior Lisp.

`C-z !   (default-directory-lisp)'
     sets the default inferior Lisp directory to the directory of the current
     buffer.  If called in an inferior Lisp buffer, it sets the Emacs
     `default-directory' to the Lisp default directory.

Switching between interactive and raw keyboard modes
====================================================


There are two keyboard modes for interacting with the inferior Lisp,
interactive" and "raw".  Normally you are in interactive mode where
keys are interpreted as commands to EMACS and nothing is sent to the
inferior Lisp unless a specific command does so.  In raw mode, all
characters are passed directly to the inferior Lisp without any
interpretation as EMACS commands.  Keys will not be echoed unless
ilisp-raw-echo is T.


Raw mode can be turned on interactively by the command
`raw-keys-ilisp' (`C-z #') and will continue until you type C-g.  Raw
mode can also be turned on/off by inferior Lisp functions if the
command `io-bridge-ilisp' (`M-x io-bridge-ilisp') has been executed in
the inferior Lisp either interactively or on a hook.  To turn on raw
mode, a function should print `^[1^]' and to turn it off should print
`^[0^]'.  An example in Common Lisp would be:

`(progn (format t "^[1^]") (print (read-char)) (format t "^[0^]"))'

Interrupts, aborts, and errors
==============================


If you want to abort the last command you can use `C-g'.

If you want to abort all commands, you should use the command
`abort-commands-lisp' (`C-z g').  Commands that are aborted will be
put in the buffer `*Aborted Commands*' so that you can see what was
aborted.  If you want to abort the currently running top-level
command, use `interrupt-subjob-ilisp' (`C-c C-c').  As a last resort,
`M-x panic-lisp' will reset the ILISP state without affecting the
inferior Lisp so that you can see what is happening.


`delete-char-or-pop-ilisp' (`C-d') will delete prefix characters
unless you are at the end of an ILISP buffer in which case it will pop
one level in the break loop.

`reset-ilisp', (`C-z z') will reset the current inferior Lisp's
top-level so that it will no longer be in a break loop.


Summary:

`C-c C-c   (interrupt-subjob-ilisp)'
     Send a keyboard interrupt signal to lisp.
`C-z g    (abort-commands-lisp)'
     Abort all running or unsent commands.
`M-x panic-lisp (panic-lisp)'
     Reset the ILISP process state.
`C-z z   (reset-ilisp)'
     Reset Lisp to top-level.
`C-d   (delete-char-or-pop-ilisp)'
     If at end of buffer, pop a level in break loop.


If `lisp-wait-p' is `nil'  (the default),
all sends are done asynchronously and the results will be
brought up only if there is more than one line or there is an error.
In case, you will be given the option of ignoring the error, keeping
it in another buffer or keeping it and aborting all pending sends.
If there is not a command already running in the inferior Lisp, you can
preserve the break loop.  If called with a negative prefix, the sense of
`lisp-wait-p' will be inverted for the next command.

Interface to Lisp debuggers
===========================

ILD is an interface to Lisp debuggers, currently the ones of the AKCL,
Allegro, CLISP, CMU CL, Corman Lisp and Lucid Common Lisp dialects. It
uses a standard set of single-keystroke commands to interface to a
variety of different debuggers and is vaguely modelled after the
Symbolics debugger. It provides two key advantages: single keystrokes
for moving up and down the stack, and a uniform interface to different
debuggers.

Not all debugger commands are available in all implementations. Some
are, but further work is needed. These are noted in the code (see the
dialect definition files). If you know how to fix them please contact
the ILISP maintainer.

Here is a list of the available ILD commands:

`M-a   (ild-abort)'
     Abort.
`M-c   (ild-continue)'
     Continue.
`M-C-n   (ild-next)'
     Next stack frame (with numeric argument *n*, move to the next
     *n*-th stack frame).
`M-C-p   (ild-previous)'
     Previous stack frame (with numeric argument *n*, move to the
     previous *n*-th stack frame).
`C-c <   (ild-top)'
     Top stack frame.
`C-c >   (ild-bottom)'
     Bottom stack frame.
`M-b   (ild-backtrace)'
     Backtrace.
`M-C-d   (ild-locals)'
     Display all local variables.
`M-C-l   (ild-local)'
     Display a particular local variable (with numeric argument *n*,
     display the *n*-th local variable).
`M-C-s   (ild-step)'
     Step to the next breakpoint.
`C-c r   (ild-return)'
     Return.
`M-C-r   (ild-retry)'
     Retry.
`C-x t   (ild-trap-on-exit)'
     Trap on exit.
`C-c L   (select-lisp)'
     Select Lisp interaction buffer.
`C-z C-s   (slow-lisp)'
     Set compiler options for maximal debuggability.
`C-z C-f   (fast-lisp)'
     Set compiler options for fastest but least debuggable code.

Command history
===============

ILISP mode is built on top of `comint-mode', the general
command-interpreter-in-a-buffer mode.  As such, it inherits many
commands and features from this, including a command history
mechanism.

Each ILISP buffer has a command history associated with it.  Commands
that do not match `ilisp-filter-regexp' and that are longer than
`ilisp-filter-length' and that do not match the immediately prior
command will be added to this history.


`M-n   (comint-next-input)'
`M-p   (comint-previous-input)'
     Cycle through the input history.

`M-s    (comint-previous-similar-input)'
     Cycle through input that has the string typed so far as a prefix.

`M-N    (comint-psearch-input)'
     Search forwards for prompt.
`M-P    (comint-msearch-input)'
     Search backwards for prompt.

`C-c R   (comint-msearch-input-matching)'
     Search backwards for occurrence of prompt followed by string
     which is prompted for (*not* a regular expression).

See `comint-mode' documentation for more information on
`comint' commands.

Completion
==========

Commands to reduce number of keystrokes.

`M-TAB   (complete-lisp)'
     will try to complete the previous symbol in the current inferior
     Lisp.  Partial completion is supported unless
     `ilisp-*prefix-match*' is set to `t'.  (If you set it to `t',
     inferior Lisp completions will be faster.)  With partial
     completion, `p--n' would complete to `position-if-not' in Common
     Lisp.  If the symbol follows a left paren or a `#'', only symbols
     with function cells will be considered.  If the symbol starts
     with a `*' or you call with a positive prefix all possible
     completions will be considered.  Only external symbols are
     considered if there is a package qualification with only one
     colon.  The first time you try to complete a string the longest
     common substring will be inserted and the cursor will be left on
     the point of ambiguity.  If you try to complete again, you can
     see the possible completions.  If you are in a string, then
     filename completion will be done instead.  And if you try to
     complete a filename twice, you will see a list of possible
     completions.  Filename components are completed individually, so
     `/u/mi/' could expand to `/usr/misc/'.  If you complete with a
     negative prefix, the most recent completion (symbol or filename)
     will be undone.


`M-RET   (complete)'
     will complete the current symbol to the most recently seen symbol
     in Emacs that matches what you have typed so far.  Executing it
     repeatedly will cycle through potential matches.  This is from
     the TMC completion package and there may be some delay as it is
     initially loaded.

Miscellany
==========

Indentation, parenthesis balancing, movement and comment commands.


``TAB'   (indent-line-ilisp)'
     indents for Lisp.  With prefix, shifts rest of expression rigidly
     with the current line.


`M-C-q   (indent-sexp-ilisp)'
     will indent each line in the next sexp.

`M-q   (reindent-lisp)'
     will reindent the current paragraph if in a comment or string.
     Otherwise it will close the containing defun and reindent it.

`C-a   (bol-ilisp)'
     will go after the prompt as defined by `comint-prompt-regexp' or
     `ilisp-other-prompt' or to the left margin with a prefix.

`DEL   (backward-delete-char-untabify)'
     converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.

`C-z ;   (comment-region-lisp)'
     will put prefix copies of `comment-start' before and
     `comment-end''s after the lines in region.  To uncomment a
     region, use a minus prefix.

`C-z )   (find-unbalanced-lisp)'
     will find unbalanced parens in the current buffer.  When called
     with a prefix it will look in the current region.

Dialects
********

A "dialect" of Lisp is a specific implementation.  For the parts of
Common Lisp which are well specified, they are usually the same.  For
the parts that are not (debugger, top-level loop, etc.), there is
usually the same functionality but different commands.

ILISP provides the means to specify these differences so that the
ILISP commands will use the specific command peculiar to an
implementation, but still offer the same behavior with the same
interface.

File: ilisp.info, Node: Defining new dialects, Next: Writing new commands, Up: Dialects

Defining new dialects
=====================


To define a new dialect use the macro `defdialect'.  For examples,
look at the dialect definitions in `ilisp-acl.el', `ilisp-cmu.el',
`ilisp-kcl.el', `ilisp-luc.el'.  There are hooks and variables for
almost anything that you are likely to need to change.  The
relationship between dialects is hierarchical with the root values
being defined in `setup-ilisp'.  For a new dialect, you only need to
change the variables that are different than in the parent dialect.




File: ilisp.info, Node: Writing new commands, Prev: Defining new dialects, Up: Dialects

Writing new commands
====================

Basic tools for creating new commands:
`deflocal'
     Define a new buffer local variable.
`ilisp-dialect'
     List of dialect types.  For specific dialect clauses.
`lisp-symbol'
     Create a symbol.
`lisp-symbol-name'
     Return a symbol's name
`lisp-symbol-delimiter'
     Return a symbol's qualification
`lisp-symbol-package'
     Return a symbol's package
`lisp-string-to-symbol'
     Convert string to symbol
`lisp-symbol-to-string'
     Convert symbol to string
`lisp-buffer-symbol'
     Convert symbol to string qualified for buffer
`lisp-previous-symbol'
     Return previous symbol
`lisp-previous-sexp'
     Return previous sexp
`lisp-def-name'
     Return name of current definition
`lisp-function-name'
     Return previous function symbol
`ilisp-read'
     Read an sexp with completion, arglist, etc
`ilisp-read-symbol'
     Read a symbol or list with completion
`ilisp-completing-read'
     Read from choices or list with completion

Notes:
   * Special commands like arglist should use `ilisp-send' to send a
     message to the inferior Lisp.

   * Eval/compile commands should use `eval-region-lisp' or
     `compile-region-lisp'.
